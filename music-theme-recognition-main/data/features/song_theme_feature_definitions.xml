      <name>Basic Pitch Histogram</name>
      <description>A feature vector consisting of bin magnitudes of the basic pitch histogram described in the jSymbolic manual. Each bin corresponds to one of the 128 MIDI pitches, ordered from lowest to highest, and with an interval of a semitone between each (enharmonic equivalents are assigned the same pitch number). Bin 60 corresponds to middle C. The magnitude of of each bin is proportional to the the number of times notes occurred at the bin's pitch in the piece, relative to all other pitches in the piece (the histogram is normalized).</description>

      <name>Pitch Class Histogram</name>
      <description>A feature vector consisting of bin magnitudes of the pitch class histogram described in the jSymbolic manual. Each bin corresponds to one of the 12 pitch classes, ordered in increasing pitch with an interval of a semitone between each (enharmonic equivalents are assigned the same pitch class number). The first bin corresponds to the most common pitch class in the piece under consideration (it does NOT correspond to a set pitch class). The magnitude of of each bin is proportional to the the number of times notes occurred at the bin's pitch class in the piece, relative to all other pitch classes in the piece (the histogram is normalized).</description>

      <name>Folded Fifths Pitch Class Histogram</name>
      <description>A feature vector consisting of bin magnitudes of the folded fifths pitch class histogram described in the jSymbolic manual. Each bin corresponds to one of the 12 pitch classes, and the bins are ordered such that adjacent bins are separated by an ascending perfect fifth. Bin 0 corresponds to C. Enharmonic equivalents are assigned the same pitch class number. The magnitude of of each bin is proportional to the the number of times notes occurred at the bin's pitch class in the piece, relative to all other pitch classes in the piece (the histogram is normalized).</description>

   <feature>
      <name>Melodic Interval Histogram</name>
      <description>A feature vector consisting of the bin magnitudes of the melodic interval histogram described above. Each bin corresponds to a melodic interval, and the bin index indicates the number of semitones comprising the interval associated with the bin (there are 128 bins in all). For example, bin 0 corresponds to repeated pitches, bin 1 to a melodic interval of one semitone, bin 2 to a melodic interval of 2 semitones, etc. The magnitude of each bin is proportional to the fraction of melodic intervals in the piece that are of the kind associated with the bin (this histogram is normalized). Rising and falling intervals are treated as identical. Melodies are assumed to be contained within individual MIDI tracks and channels, so melodic intervals are found separately for each track and channel before being combined in this histogram. It is also assumed that there is only one melody at a time per MIDI channel (if multiple notes occur simultaneously on the same MIDI tick on the same MIDI track and channel, then all notes but the first note on that tick are ignored). Other than this, all notes on the same track and the same channel are treated as if they are part of a single melody. It is also assumed that melodies do not cross MIDI tracks or channels (i.e. that they are each separately contained in their own track and channel). Only pitched notes are considered, so all notes on the unpitched MIDI Channel 10 are ignored.</description>

      <name>Vertical Interval Histogram</name>
      <description>A feature vector consisting of bin magnitudes of the vertical interval histogram described in the jSymbolic manual. Each of the bins is associated with a different vertical pitch interval, and is labeled with the number of semitones in that corresponding interval. More specifically, these are numbered from 0 (a unison) to 127 (a vertical interval of 127 semitones). The magnitude of each bin is found by going through a recoding MIDI tick by MIDI tick and noting all vertical intervals that are sounding at each tick, as well as the MIDI velocities of the pair of notes involved in each vertical interval. The end result is a histogram that indicates which vertical intervals are present, and how significant these vertical intervals are relative to one another, with a weighting based on both MIDI velocity and the aggregated durations with which each interval is held throughout the piece. Finally, the histogram is normalized.</description>

      <name>Wrapped Vertical Interval Histogram</name>
      <description>A feature vector consisting of bin magnitudes of the wrapped vertical interval histogram described in the jSymbolic manual. Each of the bins is associated with a different vertical pitch interval, and is labeled with the number of semitones in that corresponding interval. More specifically, these are numbered from 0 (a unison) to 11 (a vertical interval of 11 semitones). The magnitude of each bin is found by going through a recoding MIDI tick by MIDI tick and noting all vertical intervals that are sounding at each tick, as well as the MIDI velocities of the pair of notes involved in each vertical interval. Intervals larger than 11 semitones are wrapped (e.g. an octave (12 semitones) is added to the bin for unisons (0 semitones)). The end result is a histogram that indicates which vertical intervals are present, and how significant these vertical intervals are relative to one another, with a weighting based on both MIDI velocity and the aggregated durations with which each interval is held throughout the piece. Finally, the histogram is normalized.</description>

      <name>Chord Type Histogram</name>
      <description>A feature vector consisting of bin magnitudes of the chord type histogram described in the jSymbolic manual. This is a normalized histogram that has bins labeled with types of chords (in the following order and with the indicated identifying codes): partial chords consisting of just two pitch classes [0], minor triads [1], major triads [2], diminished triads [3], augmented triads [4], other triads [5], minor seventh chords [6], dominant seventh chords [7], major seventh chords [8], other chords consisting of four pitch classes [9], and complex chords with more than four pitch classes [10]. The bin magnitudes are calculated by going through MIDI ticks one by one and incrementing the counter for the bin that corresponds to the chord, if any, that is present during eah given tick; the result is that the chords in this histogram are weighted by the duration with which each chord is played. All inversions are treated as equivalent and octave doubling is ignored in the calculation of this histogram. Melodic behaviour is not considered, so arpeggios are not counted in this histogram.</description>

      <name>Rhythmic Value Histogram</name>
      <description>A feature vector, representing a normalized histogram where the value of each bin specifies the fraction of all notes in the music with a rhythmic value corresponding to that of the given bin.

Both pitched and unpitched notes are included in this histogram. Tempo is, of course, not relevant to this histogram. Notes with durations not precisely matching one of these rhythmic note values are mapped to the closest note value (to filter out the effects of rubato or uneven human rhythmic performances, for example).

      <name>Beat Histogram Tempo Standardized</name>
      <description>A feature vector consisting of the bin magnitudes of the beat histogram described in the jSymbolic manual. However, the tempo of the music is standardized to 120 BPM throughout the piece before this histogram is calculated. This means that variations in tempo within a single piece are in effect eliminated for the purposes of this histogram. The tempo-independent beat histograms of different pieces can also be compared in a way that is independent of potential tempo differences between the pieces. Rubato and dynamics do still influence the tempo-independent beat histogram, however. Also, the first 40 bins are not included in this feature vector, as is the case with the basic beat histogram. Each bin corresponds to a different beats per minute periodicity, with tempo increasing with the bin index. The magnitude of each bin is proportional to the cumulative loudness (MIDI velocity) of the notes that occur at that bin's rhythmic periodicity. The histogram is normalized.</description>

Note that only transitions from one set of pitches to another set of pitches comprising the same number of pitches as the first are included in this calculation, although a brief lookahead is performed in order to accommodate small rhythmic desynchronizations (e.g. if a MIDI file is a transcription of a human performance). Only unique pitches are included in this calculation (unisons are treated as a single pitch). All pitches present are considered, regardless of their MIDI channel or track; this has the advantage of accommodating polyphonic instruments such as piano or guitar, but the consequence is that this feature does not incorporate an awareness of voice crossing.</description>

All pitches present are considered, regardless of their MIDI channel or track; this has the advantage of accommodating polyphonic instruments such as piano or guitar, but the consequence is that this feature does not incorporate an awareness of voice crossing.</description>
