# Online Band (GaragageBand on the web)

## <a href="http://chenvic.com/onlineband" target="_blank">Demo (current progress) </a>

With the introduction to HTML5 and web audio, we can now play audios natively without having to rely on flash/silverlight/quicktime/...etc. This project aims to bring the awesomeness of GarageBand completely to the web!

## Technologies (as of now, open to changes!)
- jQuery - Simple DOM manipulations
- jQuery UI - Powerful drag/drop/animation features
- underscore.js - Keeps code short and clean with its functional helpers
- howler.js - Awesome web audio wrapper that is easy to use
- backbone.js - lightweight framework that offers clean separation of logic (models and views)

## Getting Started

```

bower install
